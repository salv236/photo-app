# Features under review

Current the website is 75% completed, viewport for smartphones has to be addressed. In addition I would like to add an animation where as you seelct a picture category within the navuigation that a fade effect is applied at onload which should be achievable with Javascript. 

The hamburger menu used jquery for the show/hide of the menu which is a temporary solution until i am able to determine how this can be achieved with Raw Javascript.
